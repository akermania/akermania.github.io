<p>Hi,
    <br><br>
    My name is Tal Akerman, recently relocated to Germany with my wife to her new job in Munich. 
    I'm working as a data analytics software engineer at Apple for almost 6 years, and an Astrophotographer on my spare time. 
</p>
    Germany is very cloudy in the winter, and according to my wife, this is what I look like on these cloudy nights ðŸ˜…: 
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    So I like to find myself challenging projects, usually Astronomy related, and decided to start documenting everyting in the process and share it with the public. 
</p>

    I hope you will find the content interesting and helpful!
