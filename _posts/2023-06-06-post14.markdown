Now that we're back on track, the real fun begins - wiring the entire thing, and I'm already starting to regret this...  
We'll need a lot of wires, and we'd prefer something ready with all the pins but apparently no one wants to do it, so we're stuck with this job.

I ordered 8,5,3 and 2 core 26AWG wires, a set of JST XH2.54 connectors with 2,3,4,5 pins, Dupont connectors kit and crimp tool, SP13 IP68 plugs with 4 and 9 pins (I'll post more details in the final BOM).

The idea is to use the JST XH2.54 connectors to connect between the sensors and PCB for easy replacement or upgrades.  
The SP13 connectors are for the power delivery to the system, and the connection between the small side housing to the main case - that way I can attach and detach it whenever I need plus it will be more weather proof and wire mess.

I needed a precision of a brain surgeon and obviously once you think you're done things start to get harder - bad crimping, bad soldering, bad... just bad.   
Just look at this mess

But after days of working, soldering, crimping, cursing, connecting, checking and other present participle words, I didn't finish. 
I had to do more of it for a few more days to get everything together and finally! It's alive!

It's time to fire up this thing and start collecting some data !

We're there !!
