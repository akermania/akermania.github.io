About 3 months ago, I got an email from a stranger that read my blog, let's call him Travis. 
Travis was impressed by this project and offered to send me his Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB as a gift (!!!)   
To be honest, I completely forgot about it, and out of the blue a package came in last week - behold ! It's a new Raspberry Pi!

Already over the weekend I installed everything that was needed and I'm back !

Thank you Travis!
