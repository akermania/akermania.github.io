Can You Hear It? Thatâ€™s the Sweet Sound of the Finish Line!
Get everything that hanging out of the fridge and mount it with a double sided tape to the back of the fridge.

Make sure youâ€™re not blocking any vents, cooling elements, or other components that need breathing room. Good airflow = happy fridge.
Leave enough slack for easy access, but keep the wires tidy. Cable ties or clips work wonders here.

Take a step back, admire your work, and bask in the glow of your almost-finished masterpiece. Victory is just a few clicks away!

\*I've added an external antenna as my fridge is in the basement and the WiFi signal was weak - but that's for a another day.

Assuming that you did everything correctly, then the moment you plug in the fridge, everything should work like a charm.

That said... if youâ€™ve accidentally created a time machine disguised as a fridge (and letâ€™s be honest, itâ€™s always a possibility), try not to bring back any creatures from that movie. You know the one. The one with the creatures. And the chaos. And the Time Travel. Yeah, that one.

But hey, if you do find yourself staring down a fridge full of time-traveling chaos, call me. Iâ€™ll bring the popcorn.

Now plug it in, cross your fingers (just in case), and get ready to enjoy your science-backed masterpiece! ðŸš€

Next up - We'll go over the software!
