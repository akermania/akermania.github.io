Hi,  
My name is Tal Akerman, recently relocated to Germany with my wife to her new job in Munich.  
I'm working as a data analytics software engineer at Apple for almost 6 years, and an Astrophotographer on my spare time.  

Germany is very cloudy in the winter, and according to my wife, this is what I look like on these cloudy nights ðŸ˜…:

So I like to find myself challenging projects, usually Astronomy related, and decided to start documenting everyting in the process and share it with the public.   
    
I hope you will find the content interesting and helpful!
