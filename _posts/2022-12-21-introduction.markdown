Hi,  
My name is Tal Akerman, recently relocated to Germany with my wife to her new job in Munich.  
I'm working as a data analytics software engineer at Apple for almost 8 years, and an Astrophotographer on my spare time.

Germany is very cloudy in the winter, and according to my wife, this is what I look like on these cloudy nights ðŸ˜…:

So I like to find myself challenging projects, usually Astronomy related but not only, and decided to start documenting everyting in the process and share it with the public.

I have a rule that I follow in both my personal life and work - if I do it 3 times, the 4th time should be automated.

I hope you will find the content interesting and helpful!

~Tal
