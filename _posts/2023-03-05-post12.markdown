Just when everything went well, my (only) RPi went dead without any possibility of rescue (the green light of death, or SDRAM failure, it wasn't decided yet on COD)...  
There is literally no RPi4 stock anywhere, and the shady stores or private people are selling it at outrageous prices.

So unless you have an RPi4 to sell or donate, it's probably going to be a while until I will get my hands on a new one, and until then - the project is on halt. ðŸ˜“

Hope to bring good news soon...
