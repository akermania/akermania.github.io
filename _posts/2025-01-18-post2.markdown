So, you’ve decided to embark on this slightly unhinged but absolutely genius project. Great choice!  
Now, let’s break down what you’ll need to create this marvel of modern DIY engineering.

Tip - get what you can from AliExpress, it's way cheaper and will arrive in less than a week - I've included some links, nothing is affiliated.

1. <span><font style="font-weight: bold">A Wine Fridge (or Any Fridge, Really) - </font></span> It doesn’t have to be a wine fridge—get creative. Maybe there’s a Ferrero Rocher fridge out there (and if not, we’re missing out).  
   The key here is <span><font style="font-weight: bold">thermoelectric technology:</font></span> It’s a closed system, meaning better control , and unlike compressor-based fridges, it won’t flood your project with excess humidity.

   <span><font style="font-weight: bold">Important Tip:</font></span> Opt for a “low-tech” model with physical buttons for temperature control. Why? Because we’re going to tap into those buttons and let the microcontroller do the heavy lifting. Fancy touchscreens are cool, but they’ll only complicate things.

2. <span><font style="font-weight: bold">A Small (but Mighty) <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00R4JI1U6">Dehumidifier</a> - </font></span> Skip those flimsy USB-powered ones that can barely dehumidify themselves. You need something with a little more power, like [this one]. It’s compact but capable—perfect for the job.

3. <span><font style="font-weight: bold">An <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09VGX23DS">80mm PWM-Controlled Fan</a> - </font></span> This will replace the stock fan in the dehumidifier, which sounds like a rocket taking off. With PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), we can control the fan speed and airflow—because we want a gentle breeze, not a windstorm in there.

4. <span><font style="font-weight: bold"><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001381881723.html">DIY Mist Maker</a> Module (Optional but Awesome) - </font></span> Yes, you could just throw in a wet sponge and call it a day. But let’s face it—accuracy and automation are the whole point here. The mist maker adds a touch of finesse, though the system is fully functional without it. But seriously, just get it.

5. <span><font style="font-weight: bold"><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32807887667.html">ESP32 Microcontroller</a> - </font></span> This little brain of the operation will:

   - Manage the system’s programs.
   - Host your web app.
   - For my build, I recommend the 30-pin Type-C version for simplicity.

6. <span><font style="font-weight: bold"><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001722606573.html">AHT10 Sensor</a> - </font></span> Accurate temperature and humidity readings? Yes, please. This sensor ensures the whole system works like a dream.

7. <span><font style="font-weight: bold"><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002867727977.html">Two-Way Relay</a> - </font></span> You’ll need this to control both the humidifier and dehumidifier. Because automation is life.

8. <span><font style="font-weight: bold"><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005124529319.html">Round TFT 1.28” Screen</a> (Optional) - </font></span> Not strictly necessary, but a display adds that extra “wow” factor and lets you monitor everything at a glance.

9. <span><font style="font-weight: bold">Step-Down Modules - </font></span> Here’s where my backstory comes in handy. The fridge I used <i>technically</i> had 5V and 9V outputs, which could have saved me some effort. But, of course, they didn’t have enough power to run all my components and things kept breaking. Save yourself the trouble and get external step-down modules instead.
   Hook them up to the fridge’s main power cable, and you’re good to go.

   - <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33051556213.html"><u>110–230V AC (fridge power source) to 5V 2A</u></a> for the microcontroller, relays, sensor, humidifier module, and screen.
   - <u><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000108431568.html">110–230V AC to 9V 5A</a></u> for the dehumidifier module and fan (or adjust based on your specific dehumidifier’s needs).

   Pro tip: Avoid cheap, sketchy modules unless you enjoy fireworks—inside your house.

10. <span><font style="font-weight: bold">Wires—Lots of Wires - </font></span> also connectors. Seriously, stock up. You’re going to need more than you think. like <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007079265201.html">this</a>, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006864064523.html">this</a>, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002646300836.html">and this</a>.

As usual, tools you will need:

- A brain (any model will do).
- Soldering tools.
- A 3D printer for the dehumidifier, humidifier and sensor enclosures - optional.
- Crimp tool for the wiring.
- A computer to load the software to the microcontroller.

With these components, you’re all set to start building your very own Smart Drying & Curing System!  
Stay tuned for the next post, where we’ll dive into putting it all together—Dexter’s Lab style.
